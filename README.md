# Kitty Collisions
 A Unity app that models elastic collisions between cylindrical objects. Inspired by the "Knockout" GamePigeon game. This is my final project for AP Physics C: Mechanics.

Sprites drawn by project partner, Emma Randall-Jarrard.

## About
All collisions are modeled using Unity's Rigidbody physics system. In order to simulate realistic, each cat is modeled as sitting on a 3D cyllindrical puck on a frictionless surface. The collisions are also assumed to be elastic, meaning mechanical energy is conserved before and after the collision.

## Hosting
The game is hosted on Netlify at https://kittycollisions.netlify.app/. Feel free to try it out!
